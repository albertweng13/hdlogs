# Sprint Plan

This file provides an overview of all sprints for the MVP.

## Sprint Overview

### Sprint 01: Core MVP - Client and Workout Management
**Status**: COMPLETE

Build the foundation: project setup, Google Sheets integration, API endpoints, and single-page frontend for adding clients, viewing client list, inputting workouts, and viewing workout history.

### Sprint 02: Enhancements and Data Management
**Status**: COMPLETE

Enhance the MVP with data management capabilities (edit/delete clients and workouts), improved user experience (search/filtering, better validation, responsive design), and workout enhancements (quick date selection, copy previous workout).

**Test Results**: 73/74 tests passing (98.6%). All Sprint 02 feature tests passing (27/27). 1 pre-existing credentials test failure (unrelated to Sprint 02).

## Sprint Status Values

- `NOT_STARTED` - Sprint not yet begun
- `IN_PROGRESS` - Sprint is active
- `COMPLETE` - Sprint is finished

## How to Use This File

1. **Check** which sprint is current (lowest number with `NOT_STARTED` or `IN_PROGRESS`)
2. **Read** the corresponding sprint file (e.g., `sprint-01.md`)
3. **Work on tasks** from that sprint file
4. **Update** sprint status when complete

## Sprint Philosophy

- **MVP-focused**: Each sprint moves toward MVP completion
- **Atomic tasks**: Tasks are small and completable
- **Test-driven**: Every task includes tests
- **Retro-driven**: Learn from each sprint

**This plan will be updated as sprints are completed.**
